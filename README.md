Hiya

I'm a college student majoring in Information Tech that likes taking lots of naps, sobbing while watching Star Trek TNG 
because the writing/acting is just *chef's kiss*, swimming with the goal of becoming an actual fish, and doing archery 
because Lord of the Rings convinced me as a kid that only cool adults do it.
